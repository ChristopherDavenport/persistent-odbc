persistent-odbc
===============
Using [Persistent package](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/persistent) with ODBC-databases 
throw [HDBC-odbc](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hdbc-odbc).

Thanks to Dmitry Olshansky at https://github.com/odr/persistent-odbc/
for doing the initial hookup to hdbc-odbc.

Supports Postgres, MySql, MS Sql Server and Oracle.

Limit and Offset are not yet supported in MS Sql Server and Oracle.

This requires the modified version of Persistent in this repository to work.
